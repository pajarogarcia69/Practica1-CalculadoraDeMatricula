# Calculadora De Matricula y Descuento
We are going to carry out a practice of a problem where we are going to implement the two-layer programming architecture

This is the problem we are going to solve.

San Mateo University wants a program to stimulate students for their good academic performance and requires the following information: Type of student (Undergraduate (1) or Postgraduate (2)), Name, ID and accumulated average per semester (between 0 and 5 inclusive). If the student is an undergraduate and the average is 4.5 or higher, then they will take 28 credits and a 25% discount will be given. If the average is greater than or equal to 4.0 but less than 4.5, then you will take 25 credits and you will receive a 10% discount. If the average is greater than or equal to 3.5 and less than 4.0, you will take 20 credits and a 5% discount will be given. If the average is greater than or equal to 2.5 and less than 3.5, 15 credits will be taken and there will be no discount. If the average is less than 2.5, you will not be able to enroll. Now, if the student is a postgraduate and the average is greater than or equal to 4.5, they will take 20 credits and a 20% discount will be given. If the average is less than 4.5, you will take 10 credits and there will be no discount. Make a program with business rules that determines how much a student must pay and how many credits if the value of each credit is $50,000 for undergraduate and $150,000 for graduate.

Note: Averages and values may change at any time.
